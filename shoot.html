							<p>Rapper-comedian Andrew E.'s original hit from 2003, which lately reemerged into a viral TikTok dance trend, is now a Vivamax original movie, too. Titled "Shoot! Shoot!: Di Ko Siya Titigilan!" he is reunited with director Al Tantay in this latest flick, which also stars newbie sexy actresses AJ Raval and Sunshine Guimary. In a virtual interview, Andrew E. admitted he was surprised when his old hit gained a new generation of listeners on TikTok. "I wrote 'Shoot-Shoot' 18 years ago and I was thinking noong panahon na 'yon, usong-uso yung mga long-distance relationship. Noong pumasok 'yon sa isip ko, I thought, might as well gumawa ako ng kanta about long-distance relationships na very imaginative," the recalled. poster Fast forward to the present, the rapper-comedian shared he only found out his song was being played again because his children were on TikTok. Still in disbelief, Viva called him soon enough and offered him to star in a movie inspired by Shoot, Shoot. "Nagulat nga ako. It was my kids telling me, 'Papa, is this your song?' Sabi ko 'What song? I don't have a new one.' 'Shoot Shoot!, it's all over TikTok.' I couldn't believe it. Honestly, I thought it had its run. So, it's a surprise to me na magugustuhan ng new generation of music listeners ang song," he chuckled gratefully.

"Ako naman hindi ko rin alam na there would be a Shoot! Shoot! [movie] na magbabalik mula sa sa lunggaan 18 years ago. I didn't see it coming. I must admit I feel so lucky to have been given this chance," Andrew E. averred.




Shoot! Shoot! the movie, finds Andrew E. as Jack, a small-town guy whose ultimate dream is to become an actor. After countless auditions, Jack is finally chosen to play the role of an heir to a wealthy relative.

While rehearsing his lines, his neighbor hears him talking about inheriting $100 billion. His misadventures begin here as word swiftly spreads around town that he is now a billionaire.

Naturally, he suddenly finds everyone swarming to him, including girls who are only after his money. Soon enough, he also gets entangled with bad news folks and is forced to come up with a plan to get out of the initially desirable situation that had always been a lie. According to Andrew E., the film sticks to the classic '90s style of slapstick and sexy comedy, and should prove nostalgic for viewers of his generation. All the same, younger folks should also enjoy the movie which combines funny puns and one-liners they can relate to, together with the rapper's brand of comedy.

"Shoot! Shoot!: Di Ko Siya Titigilan!" also stars Juliana Parizcova Segovia and Wilbert Ross. It premieres today via Vivamax's pay-per-view service Vivamax Plus, with regular streaming beginning October 8 across Vivamax Philippines, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Japan, Middle East and Europe.</p>
