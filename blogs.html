							<p>"Shoot! Shoot! Di Ko Siya Titigilan!" is one of those films that never should have been made in the first place. Its crass, dirty, and  exploitative humor should have been left in the past and we won't deny that it could make you laugh with its low-ball humor - but we seriously hope you check yourself if you find this kind of comedy top-notch entertainment. Nothing in this film makes sense and it was pretty obvious that it was made to entertain for those not actually looking for laughs.</p>
