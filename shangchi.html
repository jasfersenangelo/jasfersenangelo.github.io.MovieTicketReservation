							<p>Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings debuted with an impressive post-pandemic box office haul in its opening weekend, but the true testament to Shang-Chi's great box office performance is its low second-weekend drop. The 2021 box office has bounced back in a big way from the abysmal 2020 box office during the height of the coronavirus pandemic, but it's still not back to pre-pandemic levels, and may never get there. Even so, Shang-Chi shows there's still hope and the box office is still sustainable for the right movies.

A lot of big post-pandemic releases have seen really poor opening weekend numbers, but even the movies that opened reasonably strong, like F9 and Black Widow, saw a consistently high drop in their second-weekend box office receipts. F9 and Black Widow both saw drops over 67%, but even movies with softer openings were seeing second-weekend drops in that range. There are a few exceptions, such as Free Guy, which only dropped an amazingly low 34.8%, but even with those legs, anything opening that low ($28 million, in Free Guys' case) is still struggling to clear $100 million at the box office, as seen with The Suicide Squad, Space Jam: A New Legacy, and others, which would have happened with ease in the pre-pandemic box office.</p>
